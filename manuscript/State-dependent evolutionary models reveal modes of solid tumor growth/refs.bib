	abstract = {Determining whether speciation and extinction rates depend on the state of a particular character has been of long-standing interest to evolutionary biologists. To assess the effect of a character on diversification rates using likelihood methods requires that we be able to calculate the probability that a group of extant species would have evolved as observed, given a particular model of the character's effect. Here we describe how to calculate this probability for a phylogenetic tree and a two-state (binary) character under a simple model of evolution (the ``BiSSE''model, binary-state speciation and extinction). The model involves six parameters, specifying two speciation rates (rate when the lineage is in state 0; rate when in state 1), two extinction rates (when in state 0; when in state 1), and two rates of character state change (from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0). Using these probability calculations, we can do maximum likelihood inference to estimate the model's parameters and perform hypothesis tests (e.g., is the rate of speciation elevated for one character state over the other?). We demonstrate the application of the method using simulated data with known parameter values.},

	abstract = {Metastatic prostate cancer is initially treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, resistance typically develops in about 1 year --a clinical condition termed metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We develop and investigate a spatial game (agent based continuous space) of mCRPC that considers three distinct cancer cell types: (1) those dependent on exogenous testosterone (T+), (2) those with increased CYP17A expression that produce testosterone and provide it to the environment as a public good (TP), and (3) those independent of testosterone (T−). The interactions within and between cancer cell types can be represented by a 3 ×3 matrix. Based on the known biology of this cancer there are 22 potential matrices that give roughly three major outcomes depending upon the absence (good prognosis), near absence or high frequency (poor prognosis) of T−cells at the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). When just two cell types coexist the spatial game faithfully reproduces the ESS of the corresponding matrix game. With three cell types divergences occur, in some cases just two strategies coexist in the spatial game even as a non-spatial matrix game supports all three. Discrepancies between the spatial game and non-spatial ESS happen because different cell types become more or less clumped in the spatial game --leading to non-random assortative interactions between cell types. Three key spatial scales influence the distribution and abundance of cell types in the spatial game: i. Increasing the radius at which cells interact with each other can lead to higher clumping of each type, ii. Increasing the radius at which cells experience limits to population growth can cause densely packed tumor clusters in space, iii. Increasing the dispersal radius of daughter cells promotes increased mixing of cell types. To our knowledge the effects of these spatial scales on eco-evolutionary dynamics have not been explored in cancer models. The fact that cancer interactions are spatially explicit and that our spatial game of mCRPC provides in general different outcomes than the non-spatial game might suggest that non-spatial models are insufficient for capturing key elements of tumorigenesis.},

@article{Kuhnert:2016vv,
	abstract = {When viruses spread, outbreaks can be spawned in previously unaffected regions. Depending on the time and mode of introduction, each regional outbreak can have its own epidemic dynamics. The migration and phylodynamic processes are often intertwined and need to be taken into account when analyzing temporally and spatially structured virus data. In this article, we present a fully probabilistic approach for the joint reconstruction of phylodynamic history in structured populations (such as geographic structure) based on a multitype birth--death process. This approach can be used to quantify the spread of a pathogen in a structured population. Changes in epidemic dynamics through time within subpopulations are incorporated through piecewise constant changes in transmission parameters.We analyze a global human influenza H3N2 virus data set from a geographically structured host population to demonstrate how seasonal dynamics can be inferred simultaneously with the phylogeny and migration process. Our results suggest that the main migration path among the northern, tropical, and southern region represented in the sample analyzed here is the one leading from the tropics to the northern region. Furthermore, the time-dependent transmission dynamics between and within two HIV risk groups, heterosexuals and injecting drug users, in the Latvian HIV epidemic are investigated. Our analyses confirm that the Latvian HIV epidemic peaking around 2001 was mainly driven by the injecting drug user risk group.},

	abstract = {Solid tumors are complex ecosystems, and heterogeneity is the major challenge for overcoming tumor relapse and metastasis. Uncovering the spatial heterogeneity of cell types and functional states in tumors is essential for developing effective treatment, especially in invasive fronts of tumor, the most active region for tumor cells infiltration and invasion. We firstly used SpaTial Enhanced REsolution Omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq) with a nanoscale resolution to characterize the tumor microenvironment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Enrichment of distinctive immune cells, suppressive immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells were identified in the 500{\textmu}m-wide zone centered bilaterally on the tumor boundary, namely invasive fronts of tumor. Furthermore, we found the damaged states of hepatocytes with overexpression of Serum Amyloid A (SAA) in invasive fronts, recruiting macrophages for facilitating further tumor invasion, and thus resulting in a worse prognosis. We also confirmed these findings in hepatocellular carcinoma and other liver metastatic cancers. Our work highlights the remarkable potential of high-resolution-spatially resolved transcriptomic approaches to provide meaningful biological insights for comprehensively dissecting the tumor ecosystem and guiding the development of novel therapeutic strategies for solid tumors.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic methods are emerging as a useful tool to understand cancer evolutionary dynamics, including tumor structure, heterogeneity, and progression. Most currently used approaches utilize either bulk whole genome sequencing (WGS) or single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) and are based on calling copy number alterations and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Here we explore the potential of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to reconstruct cancer evolutionary dynamics. scRNA-seq is commonly applied to explore differential gene expression of cancer cells throughout tumor progression. The method exacerbates the single-cell sequencing problem of low yield per cell with uneven expression levels. This accounts for low and uneven sequencing coverage and makes SNV detection and phylogenetic analysis challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that scRNA-seq data contains sufficient evolutionary signal and can be utilized in phylogenetic analyses. We explore and compare results of such analyses based on both expression levels and SNVs called from scRNA-seq data. Both techniques are shown to be useful for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships between cells, reflecting the clonal composition of a tumor. Both standardized expression values and SNVs appear to be equally capable of reconstructing a similar pattern of phylogenetic relationship. This pattern is stable even when phylogenetic uncertainty is taken in account. Our results open up a new direction of somatic phylogenetics based on scRNA-seq data. Further research is required to refine and improve these approaches to capture the full picture of somatic evolutionary dynamics in cancer.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Cancer genomic medicine relies on targeting driver genes. However, current catalogues of cancer drivers are mostly based on indirect measurements of mutation frequencies, positions or types, rather than their effect on clonal expansions in vivo. Moreover, non-genetic drivers are largely unknown, as are the epigenetic and transcriptomic effects of genetic drivers. Here we perform spatial computational inference on multiomic data with matched whole-genome sequencing, ATAC-seq and RNA-seq. Using 436 samples, we directly quantify the contribution, or lack thereof, of putative driver genes to subclonal expansions in vivo in 30 colorectal carcinomas (4-33 samples per patient, median=15). Although subclonal neutral evolution was widespread (13/26 cases with sufficient data), there were cases with clear evidence of subclonal selection (6/26) in which we measured epigenetic and transcriptomic differences between subclones in vivo. In 7/26 cases we could not distinguish between neutral or selective evolution with the available data. We identified expanding subclones that were not driven by known genetic alterations, and propose candidate epigenetic drivers. We identified the distinguishing patterns of genomic heterogeneity produced in fast, exponentially growing tumours (7/26) versus neoplasms growing only at the periphery (19/26), as well as identifying clonally intermixed (16/28 cases with sufficient data) versus segregated malignancies (10/28). Our model-based approach measures genetic and non-genetic subclonal selection, or lack thereof, in space and time and allows in vivo comparisons of the emergent phenotypic properties of subclones within human tumours.Competing Interest StatementF.I. receives funding from Open Targets, a public/private initiative involving academia and industry, and performs consultancy for the joint CRUK/AstraZeneca Functional Genomics Center.},

Here we leveraged a model-based evolutionary framework to investigate the demographic and biogeographic history of a colorectal cancer. Our analyses strongly support an early monoclonal metastatic colonization, followed by a rapid population expansion at both primary and secondary sites. Moreover, we infer a hematogenous metastatic spread under positive selection, plus the return of some tumoral cells from the liver back to the colon lymph nodes. This study illustrates how sophisticated techniques typical of organismal evolution can provide a detailed, quantitative picture of the complex tumoral dynamics over time and space.},

However, sequencing data are complex and often difficult to interpret. In particular, the way in which the tissue is sampled and the data are collected impact the interpretation of the results significantly. We argue that understanding cancer genomic data requires mechanistic mathematical and computational models that tell us what we expect the data to look like, with the aim of understanding the impact of confounding factors and biases in the data generation step. In this study, we develop a spatial computational model of tumour growth that also simulates the data generation process, and demonstrate that biases in the sampling step and current technological limitations severely impact the interpretation of the results. We then provide a statistical framework that can be used to start overcoming these biases and more robustly measure aspects of the biology of tumours from the data.},

@article{Yang2021,
	abstract = {Tumor evolution is driven by the progressive acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations that enable uncontrolled growth, expansion to neighboring and distal tissues, and therapeutic resistance. The study of phylogenetic relationships between cancer cells provides key insights into these processes. Here, we introduced an evolving lineage-tracing system with a single-cell RNA-seq readout into a mouse model of Kras;Trp53(KP)-driven lung adenocarcinoma which enabled us to track tumor evolution from single transformed cells to metastatic tumors at unprecedented resolution. We found that loss of the initial, stable alveolar-type2-like state was accompanied by transient increase in plasticity. This was followed by adoption of distinct fitness-associated transcriptional programs which enable rapid expansion and ultimately clonal sweep of rare, stable subclones capable of metastasizing to distant sites. Finally, we showed that tumors develop through stereotypical evolutionary trajectories, and perturbing additional tumor suppressors accelerates tumor progression by creating novel evolutionary paths. Overall, our study elucidates the hierarchical nature of tumor evolution, and more broadly enables the in-depth study of tumor progression.Competing Interest StatementJ.S.W. declares outside interest in 5 AM Venture, Amgen, Chroma Medicine, KSQ Therapeutics, Maze Therapeutics, Tenaya Therapeutics, Tessera Therapeutics and Third Rock Ventures.

    abstract = "{Spatial genetic and phenotypic diversity within solid tumors has been well documented. Nevertheless, how this heterogeneity affects temporal dynamics of tumorigenesis has not been rigorously examined because solid tumors do not evolve as the standard population genetic model due to the spatial constraint. We therefore, propose a neutral spatial (NS) model whereby the mutation accumulation increases toward the periphery; the genealogical relationship is spatially determined and the selection efficacy is blunted (due to kin competition). In this model, neutral mutations are accrued and spatially distributed in manners different from those of advantageous mutations. Importantly, the distinctions could be blurred in the conventional model. To test the NS model, we performed a three-dimensional multiple microsampling of two hepatocellular carcinomas. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed a 2-fold increase in mutations going from the center to the periphery. The operation of natural selection can then be tested by examining the spatially determined clonal relationships and the clonal sizes. Due to limited migration, only the expansion of highly advantageous clones can sweep through a large part of the tumor to reveal the selective advantages. Hence, even multiregional sampling can only reveal a fraction of fitness differences in solid tumors. Our results suggest that the NS patterns are crucial for testing the influence of natural selection during tumorigenesis, especially for small solid tumors.}",

Taking this heterogeneity into account is necessary to obtain accurate estimates of the underlying population dynamics. We present a new multitype birth–death model (MTBD) that can estimate lineage-specific birth and death rates. This corresponds to estimating lineage-dependent speciation and extinction rates for species phylogenies, and lineage-dependent transmission and recovery rates for pathogen transmission trees. In contrast with previous models, we do not presume to know the trait driving the rate differences, nor do we prohibit the same rates from appearing in different parts of the phylogeny. Using simulated data sets, we show that the MTBD model can reliably infer the presence of multiple evolutionary regimes, their positions in the tree, and the birth and death rates associated with each. We also present a reanalysis of two empirical data sets and compare the results obtained by MTBD and by the existing software BAMM. We compare two implementations of the model, one exact and one approximate (assuming that no rate changes occur in the extinct parts of the tree), and show that the approximation only slightly affects results. The MTBD model is implemented as a package in the Bayesian inference software BEAST 2 and allows joint inference of the phylogeny and the model parameters.[Birth–death; lineage specific rates, multi-type model.]}",

It can also extract the tree/branch/node-specific and other data from the analysis outputs of beast, epa, hyphy, paml, phylodog, pplacer, r8s, raxml and revbayes software, and allows using these data to annotate the tree. The package allows colouring and annotation of a tree by numerical/categorical node attributes, manipulating a tree by rotating, collapsing and zooming out clades, highlighting user selected clades or operational taxonomic units and exploration of a large tree by zooming into a selected portion. A two-dimensional tree can be drawn by scaling the tree width based on an attribute of the nodes. A tree can be annotated with an associated numerical matrix (as a heat map), multiple sequence alignment, subplots or silhouette images. The package ggtree is released under the artistic-2.0 license.

    abstract = {When multiple samples are taken from the neoplastic tissues of a single patient, it is natural to compare their mutation content. This is often done by bulk genotyping of whole biopsies, but the chance that a mutation will be detected in bulk genotyping depends on its local frequency in the sample. When the underlying mutation count per cell is equal, homogenous biopsies will have more high-frequency mutations, and thus more detectable mutations, than heterogeneous ones. Using simulations, we show that bulk genotyping of data simulated under a neutral model of somatic evolution generates strong spurious evidence for non-neutrality, because the pattern of tissue growth systematically generates differences in biopsy heterogeneity. Any experiment which compares mutation content across bulk-genotyped biopsies may therefore suggest mutation rate or selection intensity variation even when these forces are absent. We discuss computational and experimental approaches for resolving this problem.},

abstract = {Identifying the types of event that drive tumor evolution and progression is crucial for understanding cancer. We suggest that the analysis of tumor growth dynamics can provide a window into tumor biology and evolution by connecting them with the types of genetic change that have occurred. Although fundamentally important, the documentation of tumor growth kinetics is more sparse in the literature than is the molecular analysis of cells. Here, we provide a historical summary of tumor growth patterns and argue that they can be classified into five basic categories. We then illustrate how those categories can provide insights into events that drive tumor progression, by discussing a particular evolutionary model as an example and encouraging such analysis in a more general setting.}

Such phylodynamic inferences often complement or even substitute for conventional surveillance data, particularly when sampling is poor or delayed. It remains generally unknown, however, how robust phylodynamic epidemiological inferences are, especially when there is uncertainty regarding pathogen prevalence and sampling intensity. Here, we use recently developed mathematical techniques to fully characterize the information that can possibly be extracted from serially collected viral phylogenetic data, in the context of the commonly used birth-death-sampling model. We show that for any candidate epidemiological scenario, there exists a myriad of alternative, markedly different, and yet plausible “congruent” scenarios that cannot be distinguished using phylogenetic data alone, no matter how large the data set. In the absence of strong constraints or rate priors across the entire study period, neither maximum-likelihood fitting nor Bayesian inference can reliably reconstruct the true epidemiological dynamics from phylogenetic data alone; rather, estimators can only converge to the “congruence class” of the true dynamics. We propose concrete and feasible strategies for making more robust epidemiological inferences from viral phylogenetic data.}",

The limited understanding of the tumoral heterogeneity and evolutionary process of genomic alterations in pulmonary metastatic osteosarcoma impedes development of novel therapeutic strategies. Here we systematically illustrate the genomic disparities between primary tumors and corresponding pulmonary metastatic tumors by multiregional whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing in 86 tumor regions from 10 patients with osteosarcoma. Metastatic tumors exhibited a significantly higher mutational burden and genomic instability compared with primary tumors, possibly due to accumulation of mutations caused by a greater number of alterations in DNA damage response genes in metastatic tumors. Integrated analysis of the architecture and relationships of subclones revealed a dynamic mutational process and diverse dissemination patterns of osteosarcoma during pulmonary metastasis (6/10 with linear and 4/10 with parallel evolutionary patterns). All patients demonstrated more significant intertumoral rather than intratumoral heterogeneity between primary tumors and metastatic tumors. Mutated genes were enriched in the PI3K–Akt pathway at both the early and late stages of tumor evolution and in the MAPK pathway at the metastatic stage. Conversely, metastatic tumors showed improved immunogenicity, including higher neoantigen load, elevated PD-L1 expression, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes than the corresponding primary tumors. Our study is the first to report the dynamic evolutionary process and temporospatial tumor heterogeneity of pulmonary metastatic osteosarcoma, providing new insights for diagnosis and potential therapeutic strategies for pulmonary metastasis.High-throughput sequencing of primary and metastatic osteosarcoma provides new insights into the diagnosis of and potential clinical therapeutic strategies for pulmonary metastasis.}",

Sequencing data from a single biopsy represent a snapshot of this process that can reveal the timing of specific genomic aberrations and the changing influence of mutational processes3. Here, by whole-genome sequencing analysis of 2,658 cancers as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)4, we reconstruct the life history and evolution of mutational processes and driver mutation sequences of 38 types of cancer. Early oncogenesis is characterized by mutations in a constrained set of driver genes, and specific copy number gains, such as trisomy 7 in glioblastoma and isochromosome 17q in medulloblastoma. The mutational spectrum changes significantly throughout tumour evolution in 40{\%} of samples. A nearly fourfold diversification of driver genes and increased genomic instability are features of later stages. Copy number alterations often occur in mitotic crises, and lead to simultaneous gains of chromosomal segments. Timing analyses suggest that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many years, if not decades. Together, these results determine the evolutionary trajectories of cancer, and highlight opportunities for early cancer detection.},

abstract = {Summary
The evolutionary features of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have not been systematically studied to date. We analyzed 1,206 primary tumor regions from 101 patients recruited into the multi-center prospective study, TRACERx Renal. We observe up to 30 driver events per tumor and show that subclonal diversification is associated with known prognostic parameters. By resolving the patterns of driver event ordering, co-occurrence, and mutual exclusivity at clone level, we show the deterministic nature of clonal evolution. ccRCC can be grouped into seven evolutionary subtypes, ranging from tumors characterized by early fixation of multiple mutational and copy number drivers and rapid metastases to highly branched tumors with >10 subclonal drivers and extensive parallel evolution associated with attenuated progression. We identify genetic diversity and chromosomal complexity as determinants of patient outcome. Our insights reconcile the variable clinical behavior of ccRCC and suggest evolutionary potential as a biomarker for both intervention and surveillance.}

To assess the effect of a character on diversification rates using likelihood methods requires that we be able to calculate the probability that a group of extant species would have evolved as observed, given a particular model of the character's effect. Here we describe how to calculate this probability for a phylogenetic tree and a two-state (binary) character under a simple model of evolution (the “BiSSE” model, binary-state speciation and extinction). The model involves six parameters, specifying two speciation rates (rate when the lineage is in state 0; rate when in state 1), two extinction rates (when in state 0; when in state 1), and two rates of character state change (from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0). Using these probability calculations, we can do maximum likelihood inference to estimate the model's parameters and perform hypothesis tests (e.g., is the rate of speciation elevated for one character state over the other?). We demonstrate the application of the method using simulated data with known parameter values.}",

It is increasingly appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only be adequately answered by combining evidence from multiple independent sources of data, including genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data, radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and biogeographic range information among others. Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very challenging both conceptually and computationally. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments. Developing such software frameworks is increasingly a major scientific activity in its own right, and comes with specific challenges, from practical software design, development and engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such computational software platform, and was first announced over 4 years ago. Here we describe a series of major new developments in the BEAST 2 core platform and model hierarchy that have occurred since the first release of the software, culminating in the recent 2.5 release.},

abstract = {Initial SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in Washington State were driven by regional interventions and introductions of variants differing in viral loads. Understanding the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is essential to inform the development of effective antiviral measures. Studies have indicated that the D614G substitution in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein may increase transmissibility, but to what extent this variant has propelled the pandemic is debated. Analyzing thousands of viral genomes together with clinical data, Müller et al. found no evidence that the 614G variant rose in frequency in Washington State mid-2020 due to increased transmissibility or virulence. Instead, the data provided a stronger signal that the surge in 614G was explainable by its repeated introduction into the state as well as local differences in lockdown measures—both human-catalyzed factors. The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has gravely affected societies around the world. Outbreaks in different parts of the globe have been shaped by repeated introductions of new viral lineages and subsequent local transmission of those lineages. Here, we sequenced 3940 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Washington State (USA) to characterize how the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington State in early 2020 was shaped by differences in timing of mitigation strategies across counties and by repeated introductions of viral lineages into the state. In addition, we show that the increase in frequency of a potentially more transmissible viral variant (614G) over time can potentially be explained by regional mobility differences and multiple introductions of 614G but not the other variant (614D) into the state. At an individual level, we observed evidence of higher viral loads in patients infected with the 614G variant. However, using clinical records data, we did not find any evidence that the 614G variant affects clinical severity or patient outcomes. Overall, this suggests that with regard to D614G, the behavior of individuals has been more important in shaping the course of the pandemic in Washington State than this variant of the virus.}}

The dynamics of cell birth, death, and inheritance within an organism give rise to the fundamental processes of development, differentiation, and cancer. Technical advances in molecular biology now allow us to study cellular composition, ancestry, and evolution at the resolution of individual cells within an organism or tissue. Here, we take a phylogenetic and phylodynamic approach to single-cell biology. We explain how “tree thinking” is important to the interpretation of the growing body of cell-level data and how ecological null models can benefit statistical hypothesis testing. Experimental progress in cell biology should be accompanied by theoretical developments if we are to exploit fully the dynamical information in single-cell data.}}

    abstract = "{The birth–death process is widely used in phylogenetics to model speciation and extinction. Recent studies have shown that the inferred rates are sensitive to assumptions about the sampling probability of lineages. Here, we examine the effect of the method used to sample lineages. Whereas previous studies have assumed random sampling (RS), we consider two extreme cases of biased sampling: “diversified sampling” (DS), where tips are selected to maximize diversity and “cluster sampling (CS),” where sample diversity is minimized. DS appears to be standard practice, for example, in analyses of higher taxa, whereas CS may occur under special circumstances, for example, in studies of geographically defined floras or faunas. Using both simulations and analyses of empirical data, we show that inferred rates may be heavily biased if the sampling strategy is not modeled correctly. In particular, when a diversified sample is treated as if it were a random or complete sample, the extinction rate is severely underestimated, often close to 0. Such dramatic errors may lead to serious consequences, for example, if estimated rates are used in assessing the vulnerability of threatened species to extinction. Using Bayesian model testing across 18 empirical data sets, we show that DS is commonly a better fit to the data than complete, random, or cluster sampling (CS). Inappropriate modeling of the sampling method may at least partly explain anomalous results that have previously been attributed to variation over time in birth and death rates.}",
